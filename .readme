Radio is a workflow to stream online radio stations using Quicktime Player.

To stream stations just type 'RD' and you'll see a list of countries, select a country and next a radio station.
You can also directly select a country by typing r + the country code, for explame UK stations is RUK.

After opening the stream you see a Alfred notice (if enabled) of the playing radio station.
Quicktime will automaticly minimize and Apple Music and / or Spotify will automaticly pause (if playing).

Due to the fact that Quicktime Player is a native Apple app you can use the volume controls and the play pause button on your keyboard to control the player.

Note; this is the first version and the list of countries and radio stations is still limited but will be extended in coming versions.
